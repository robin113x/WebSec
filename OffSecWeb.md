# What is XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)? ðŸ¤”

```
  - It allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into websites.
  - These scripts then run in the browser of other users who visit that website.
  - The attacker can steal information, manipulate the websiteâ€™s content, or even take control of a userâ€™s session.
  - Medium Risk ( low impact + high probability = medium risk )
```

# ðŸŽ¯ Why is XSS Dangerous?
```
 - Steal cookies and session tokens (can take over user accounts). / Keylogging
 - Redirect users to malicious websites. / Phishing / URL Redirection
 - Modify the websiteâ€™s content.
 - Spread malware.
```


# ðŸ“‹ Types of XSS:
```
Stored XSS (Persistent):
	- Malicious code is saved on the websiteâ€™s server (e.g., in comments or profiles).
	- Example: An attacker writes harmful JavaScript in a comment box, and every visitor sees the harmful script.

Reflected XSS:
    - The malicious script is included in a URL or form input.
    - Example: An attacker sends a link with malicious code, and if the victim clicks it, the script runs.

DOM-based XSS:
    - Happens when the client-side script processes untrusted data.
    - Example: A websiteâ€™s JavaScript dynamically updates the page using URL parameters without validation.

# ðŸ”Ž How to Hunt for XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)?

## ðŸ›  Steps to Hunt for XSS:

### ðŸ“Œ Step 1: Identify User Input Fields
```
Look for places where a website accepts user input and displays it back. These can include:
    - Search boxes
    - Comment sections
    - Login forms
    - URL parameters (GET requests)
    - Cookies and headers
    - File upload functionality
```

# ðŸ“Œ Step 2: Test for Reflected XSS (Quick Wins)
## Reflected XSS occurs when a script is injected into a URL or input field and gets reflected back immediately.

### âœ… Payloads to Try:
#####  Basic Payloads:
```
html
Copy code
<script>alert('XSS');</script>
```

```
html
<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>
```
```
html
<svg onload=alert('XSS')>
```

### 2. In URL Parameters:
````
Try injecting payloads into URL parameters.

Example:

php
Copy code
https://example.com/search?query=<script>alert('XSS')</script>
In Input Fields:
Enter the payload in form fields, such as a login form, search box, or feedback form.
