# XSS

```
  - It allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into websites.
  - These scripts then run in the browser of other users who visit that website.
  - The attacker can steal information, manipulate the websiteâ€™s content, or even take control of a userâ€™s session.
  - Medium Risk ( low impact + high probability = medium risk )

# ðŸ“‹ Types of XSS:
```
Stored XSS (Persistent):

	Malicious code is saved on the websiteâ€™s server (e.g., in comments or profiles).
Example: An attacker writes harmful JavaScript in a comment box, and every visitor sees the harmful script.
Reflected XSS:

The malicious script is included in a URL or form input.
Example: An attacker sends a link with malicious code, and if the victim clicks it, the script runs.
DOM-based XSS:

Happens when the client-side script processes untrusted data.
Example: A websiteâ€™s JavaScript dynamically updates the page using URL parameters without validation.
