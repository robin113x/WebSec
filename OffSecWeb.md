  - These scripts then run in the browser of other users who visit that website.
  - The attacker can steal information, manipulate the websiteâ€™s content, or even take control of a userâ€™s session.
  - Medium Risk ( low impact + high probability = medium risk )

	- Example: An attacker writes harmful JavaScript in a comment box, and every visitor sees the harmful script.

Reflected XSS:
    - The malicious script is included in a URL or form input.
    - Example: An attacker sends a link with malicious code, and if the victim clicks it, the script runs.

DOM-based XSS:
    - Happens when the client-side script processes untrusted data.
    - Example: A websiteâ€™s JavaScript dynamically updates the page using URL parameters without validation.
